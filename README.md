# The last 50 years in mens' singles tennis

Most casual tennis fans and occassional players like me, tend to follow the 4 Grand Slam events annually. However, a lot of tennis gets played all over the world. I performed this analysis to provide a sense of how much tennis gets played annually, on what surfaces and how this has evolved over the years in the Open Era. Open Era is the period post 1968 when professional players were allowed at the 4 Grand Slam events.

### New metrics created

#### Dominance Score

While, not an team sport, I  analyzed the performance of individual countries against others and explored whether there is any readily detectable "_halo_" effect in tennis; i.e. does the presence of a few superstars in country raise the level of other players from the country. To do this I constructed a metric which I'll call the Dominance Score. Each country gets a score for every year based on the number of players in the top-10 and the number of weeks spent in the top 10 in given year. 

#### Heat Index

I find sports rivalries fascinating and wanted to explore the most intense rivalries over time. To measure the intensity of any rivalry, I created another metric - Heat Index. This assigns a score to each pair of players who based on total matches played, win-loss differential and number of years the pair have faced off against each other. 

Finally, the data I used for this analysis is from [Jeff Sackman](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) who publishes the wonderful tennis blog [TennisAbstract](https://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/)
